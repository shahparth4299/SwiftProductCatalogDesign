# SwiftProductCatalogDesign

iOS application dedicated to
showcasing a comprehensive laptop catalog. Through this application, users can
effortlessly explore a diverse variety of laptops.

First Screen:
The initial interface comprises a UITableViewController, where I've implemented Custom
UITableViewCells to present laptops in a visually appealing card format. Each card
includes an image of the laptop, its model name, processor details, and price.

Second Screen:
The second screen provides users with essential details about the selected laptop.
Additionally, it features a button allowing users to delve deeper into the comprehensive
features and specifications of the laptop if they're interested.

Third Screen:
On the third screen I have used Segmented Control with two segments, "Features" and
"Specifications," which guides users through an overview of the laptop. Utilizing string
parsing, I have segregated features and specifications and presented them in a
UITableView for clarity. Additionally, the screen has a "Buy Now" button, seamlessly
redirecting users to the laptop's purchase link.
